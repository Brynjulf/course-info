##Team sign up instructions

To sign up for a team, one team member should do the following steps:

* Fork this repository.
* Clone it to your local machine.
* Create a new file with extension `.grp` to the `teams/` folder. In the file, add the github account name for each team member on a separate line (see example-team.grp for an example). The name of the file does not matter as long as it does not overwrite any of the existing files in the teams folder.
* Add the new file to the git repo.
* Commit the change to your local git repo.
* Push the change to your forked repository on github.
* Create a Pull request on the original/this repository.

These instructions are essentially the same as for lab handins; see lab1 for a more detailed description.
