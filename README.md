##Important: Sign up for Unix account

To be effective in the lab on Tuesday, it is important that you sign up for an account on the Unix system prior to coming to the lab. The latest time to sign up is **Monday at 15:00**, in order to have your account ready for the lab on Tuesday. But there is no reason to delay; do it now! The instructions for sign up are here http://user.ux.uis.no/.

##Lab schedule update

Turns out that the lab room has a scheduling conflict so we won't have lab on Mondays. I've requested that the schedule be updated. You can choose when you come to the lab, but we, the teaching staff, will only be there at some given time (to be announced later). Attendance is not mandatory. Beyond that you can be in the lab when it is reserved for the course or when it is not being used by another course.
