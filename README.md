##Tentative Syllabus

The course is based on this [textbook](http://www.recursivebooks.com): 
Operating Systems: Principles and Practice, Tom Anderson and Mike Dahlin. 
You do not need the second edition. I only have the beta edition still.

All chapters listed below and Lab exercises 1-7 are syllabus. 
I will notify of any changes that may arise.

* Chapter 1: All, but in particular the concepts in 1.2.
* Chapter 2: All except 2.4 and 2.5. Sidebar on page 93 give a good summary.
* Chapter 3: All except Windows proc. management on p. 108-109.
* Chapter 4: All
* Chapter 5: All except p. 221-225 (Linux 2.6 mutex lock).
  - Sidebars on p. 211 and p. 213-215 not important for exam.
  - Rules listed on p. 237-239 are important.
* Chapter 6: All except fig. 6.11 p. 276, fig. 6.13 p. 282, and p. 289-291 (Implementing RCU)
  - 6.1 and 6.2: important.
  - Expect you to understand Banker's algorithm and deadlock detection principles, but not the two algorithms in detail.
* Chapter 7: All.
  - 7.1 and 7.2: important.
  - 7.3 not important for exam.
* Chapter 8: All.
  - 8.1-8.3: important.
  - 8.4 not important for exam.
* Chapter 9: All important.
* Chapter 10-14: Read on your own material; will not play a significant role on the exam.
